I followed a MongoDB MERN tutorial, https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mern-stack-tutorial. I was struggling originally with connecting to the mongo server. I again used MongoDB Compass for the database. When I tried using the new connection string it would not connect. I then used the connection string from a previous week Connection JSON file and it then connected. I then began running into syntax errors. In the begining I had to downgrade one of the versions in Vite possibly. Tailwind framework and directives were required and I am unsure if those were the issue. Intelisense may have been required for some compatabililty but I continued to run into issues with .JS and .JSX conflicts.

Overall I enjoyed the project. It was fun to work on and I was excited to put it together, but I am disappointed I was unable to get it to work.
